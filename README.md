# Convoy 
(ain't she a beautifal site?)

a C# Library to make building webAPIs faster and easier.

Named after the C.W. McCall song

## About
Convoy was made after I kept implementing the same things over and over again in my APIs so I decided to build a library to prevent rewriting and centralize features. I also thought publishing it would be nice for others with simmilar issues.

## Version 1.0 (Shakey town)
This build is currently a development build working towards being version 1.0 (Shakey town)

## Features

#### Current
- Error handling middleware
- Exceptions with Http status codes for easy application writing

#### Planned
- Allow people to have their own functions called from middleware for logging purposes
- (More stuff)
